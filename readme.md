# CS 121 Portfolio
This repo is a collection of my activities and projects that I have done in my CS 121 class at Ball State University.

## Overall thoughts
I loved this class! For how much I dislike java, Ladelle made this class fun and I learned a lot! I didn't only learn more about coding in Java, I also learned about OOP and it's four pillars and many other things. 

## My Work

| - | - |
| [Project 1](/projectOne/) | Character Battle - A pokemon like game |
| [Project 2](/project2/) | Test Scores - a program to calculate the letter grade of scores, sort scores|

## Activities 
Programs that aren't listed in this read me, but are in the folder, are my activities for the year. They usually are the testing ground for stuff we were learning, which led up to our lab programs most of the time.
